2022-MAY,"The Russian invasion of Ukraine comes at an inopportune time when the world and Asia-Pacific in particular, is already grappling with COVID-19 pandemic, political conflicts and climate change effects. Ukraine, Russia and Belarus are major stakeholders upstream and downstream of the global food supply chains. 

Rising food, fuel and fertilizer prices across Asia-Pacific has started to affect the structural integrity of economies in Asia. In Sri Lanka, high food prices coupled with a debt crisis has create a severe state of food insecurity that could extend into the fore-seeable future. Sustained food inflation has been attributed to be a major reason for the recent political instability in Pakistan. Mongolia is facing a looming shortage of wheat imports due to COVID-19 related border restrictions with PRC and wheat export restrictions from Russia

Several DMCs are vulnerable to a food crisis. Central and West Asian  as well as South Asian countries are already at risk or highly vulnerable.  FAO’s recent country food security analysis this month alert shortages and high prices of fertilizers and fuel in Nepal, and explains India’s unseasonal heat waves in Northwest lowered expected wheat output this year (a cause of the country’s wheat export ban). The detailed analysis on Tajikistan reports an average harvest, difficulty in wheat import and rising domestic price trend, and reduced remittance income (an important source of food expenditure, which accounts for 65% of household income).

Much to the detriment of the lessons learned from the 2008 food crisis, World Bank has reported that there is an alarming surge in government controls on food trade. Out of the 53 policy interventions that have been introduced globally since the war started, 31 restricted exports and nine of them involved wheat exports. Export and import controls currently encompass about 21% of world trade in wheat, for example—well below the 74% share at the peak of the 2008 crisis. 

The impact of the invasion on fertilizers availability remains the single largest challenge that will threaten food security in the long run.  Reduced access to nitrogenous fertilizers will severely impact rice production,  while reduced inflow of potassium will affect the horticulture in Asia and the Pacific region. Alternative suppliers of nitrogenous and potassium-based fertilizers are potentially PRC, USA and Canada, though they might only partly fill the gap.","On 14 March 2022, the UN announced the establishment of a Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance, comprised of United Nations entities and international financial institutions partners, to provide integrated analysis and develop an effective response. Together, the group will monitor and curate the emerging data and analysis with the goal of addressing the multiple crises.

On 24 March 2022, G7 leaders declared their support for make coherent use of all instruments and funding mechanisms to address any issues regarding food security and build resilience in the agriculture sector in line with climate and environment goals. The statement emphasized the need to work with MDBs to provide support for countries with acute food insecurity. The goal of avoiding export bans and other trade-restrictive measures as a response to the crisis was also emphasized.

On 7 April 2022, FAO released a response plan for the Ukraine crisis to address social protection for food security and nutrition. As a part of the document, the need to enhance social protection systems to withstand price shocks was emphasized for central Asia. 

On 18 May 2022, WFP called for opening Black Sea ports to address the deepening food crisis, in a debate at the United Nations Security Council","
IFI Action Plan to Address Food Insecurity was announced on 18 May, following a meeting convened in April by US Treasury.  The participating IFIs are ADB, WB, AfDB, EBRD, IDB, IMF, and IFAD. The Action plans support 5 goals: Supporting vulnerable people, Promoting Open trade, Mitigating Fertilizer shortage, Support for Food production, and Investment in Climate Resilience Agriculture for the Future.

World Bank released a food security update on 24 May, describing the current crisis and listing their responses and actions.",
